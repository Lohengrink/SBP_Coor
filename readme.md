# segy2segy

Part of this code package is from this link, https://github.com/jobar8/segy2segy.
I created some new function and modified some code from the link above for fixing some bugs.

SEGY_input
SEGY_output
SEGY_Nav
Please contact with new jack (k8813940518@gmail.com) to apply the demo data.

# install and env setting
If you are new here, then you can get more details from those two repo, [MCS_Nav](https://github.com/Lohengrink/MCS_Nav) and [SIL_ll2utm](https://github.com/Lohengrink/SIL_ll2utm).
There are most of the details you need to install and set the Env.

If you are our old friends, then you can follow the similar steps to set up this tool.

# run cat
change run cat to run bat

# RUN
Double-click the run.bat, then the GUI windows will open automatically.
Follow the hint from GUI, then it will be fine to convert the coordinat from the input SEGY file.

Enjoy it!
